Project Budget Resource Analyzer

## Overview

This web application is built using Angular and Flask and is designed to analyze project resource billable rates for each resource in a project and calculate the total project budget. The core of the application involves the design of the database schema, which is implemented using SQL-Alchemy. Bootstrap and Jinja 2 are used for frontend development.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Angular is used for building the frontend of the web application. It provides a structured framework for creating dynamic web pages.

- **Flask**: Flask is the backend framework that handles server-side logic, routing, and API endpoints. It integrates seamlessly with SQL-Alchemy.

- **SQL-Alchemy**: SQL-Alchemy is used for defining and interacting with the database schema. It provides an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer for working with databases.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is employed for styling and layout of the web pages. It ensures a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- **Jinja 2**: Jinja 2 is a templating engine used with Flask to generate dynamic content in HTML templates. It allows for the integration of backend data into the frontend.
